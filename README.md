# Weather-App

Developed using **React**.\
My project is a weather app where users enter a city name to instantly view real-time weather details like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

## Deployment

The Weather-App project has been deployed to the Internet. You can access it using the following URL: [Weather-App](https://weather-app-lemon-kappa.vercel.app/).

## Running the Project

### `npm start`

To run the application you need to create a user in **openweathermap** and you get an **API KEY** with which you can run the application.\
You will need to create an .env file and use this API:\
**https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={cityName}&appid={API key}**
